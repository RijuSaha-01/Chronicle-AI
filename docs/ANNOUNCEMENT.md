🎬 **Introducing Chronicle AI — Turn Your Daily Diary Into Episodic Stories**

I'm excited to share a personal project I've been working on!

**The Problem:**
We all have moments worth remembering, but daily journaling often feels mundane. What if your diary entries could feel like episodes from your own life documentary?

**The Solution:**
Chronicle AI transforms raw diary text into cinematic narratives. Using local AI (Llama 3.2 via Ollama), it:

✨ Generates engaging third-person narratives from your entries  
🎬 Creates catchy "episode titles" for each day  
📚 Exports beautiful Markdown summaries  
💻 Works via CLI, Web UI, or REST API

**Tech Stack:**
- Python + FastAPI
- SQLite for lightweight storage
- Ollama + Llama 3.2 for local AI
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend

**What makes it different:**
- 🔒 **100% Local** - Your diary stays on your machine
- ⚡ **Offline Friendly** - Works even without AI
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** - Glassmorphism design that makes journaling feel premium
- 🛠️ **Developer Friendly** - Clean API, easy to extend

**Try it out:**

I'd love feedback! What features would make this useful for your journaling workflow?

## Twitter/X Thread

🧵 Just shipped Chronicle AI — a tool that turns your diary into a TV series about YOUR life 🎬

Here's what it does ⬇️

1/ Write your diary entry (quick mode or guided Q&A) and Chronicle AI transforms it into cinematic narrative prose.

"Had coffee, worked on code, walked the dog"

Becomes:

"The protagonist starts their day with a steaming cup of coffee, the aroma filling the quiet morning air..."

2/ Every entry gets an auto-generated episode title:

"The Code & The Canine"
"Morning Momentum"
"Dawn of Productivity"

Your life deserves catchy titles! 🎥

3/ It's 100% LOCAL — uses Ollama + Llama 3.2. Your diary never leaves your machine. Privacy first. 🔒

4/ Works offline too! If AI isn't available, entries are saved and you can generate narratives later.

5/ Beautiful web UI with glassmorphism design + full CLI for terminal lovers + REST API for developers.

6/ Export to Markdown — daily entries or weekly summaries. Perfect for personal wikis or second brains.

7/ Built with:
- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- Vanilla JS
