# Chronicle AI 🎬

**Turn your daily diary logs into episodic stories with cinematic elements.**

## 🌟 Project Vision
Chronicle AI is designed to bridge the gap between habit tracking and storytelling. By framing our daily actions as part of a narrative, we can gain a fresh perspective on our choices, celebrate our wins as "hero moments," and recognize negative patterns as "recurring villains." The goal is to make personal growth feel like a cinematic journey.

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- **Episodic Transformation**: Automatically structure diary entries into morning, day, and night acts.
- **Cinematic Shot Descriptions**: AI-generated visual prompts that describe your day as if seen through a camera lens (e.g., "Close-up on the steam rising from the coffee cup as the protagonist plans the day").
- **Hero & Villain Tracking**: Assign habit categories as "Heroes" (positive) or "Villains" (negative).
- **Character Arcs**: Long-term analysis of your habits visualized as a progressive storyline.
- **Export to Script**: View your week as a screenplay.
